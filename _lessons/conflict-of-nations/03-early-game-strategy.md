## The Critical First Days

The early game in Conflict of Nations sets the foundation for everything that follows. Mistakes made now can haunt you for the rest of the game.

## Immediate Priorities

### Day 1 Actions

1. **Survey your starting position** - Understand your neighbors and resources
2. **Start key buildings** - Focus on resource production
3. **Begin unit production** - You need a military presence
4. **Scout your surroundings** - Information is power

### Initial Building Order

Your first buildings should typically be:

1. **Recruiting offices** - Enable faster unit production
2. **Arms industries** - Increase military output
3. **Infrastructure** - Improve resource efficiency

## Expansion Strategy

### Choosing Targets

When deciding where to expand, consider:

- **Resource value** - Prioritize high-output provinces
- **Strategic position** - Control chokepoints and borders
- **Defense requirements** - Can you hold what you take?
- **Neighbor reactions** - Will expansion provoke attacks?

### Neutral vs. Player Territories

Early game expansion should focus on neutral territories:

- Lower military resistance
- No diplomatic consequences
- Predictable outcomes
- Good practice for combat mechanics

## Building Your First Army

### Starting Units

Focus on a balanced initial force:

- **Infantry** - Cheap and essential for occupation
- **Motorized infantry** - Speed for rapid expansion
- **Basic armor** - Punch for taking defended provinces

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

- Don't spread too thin
- Don't neglect defense while attacking
- Don't build units you can't supply
- Don't ignore your economy

## Diplomatic Considerations

### Early Game Diplomacy

Even in the first days:

- Identify potential allies and threats
- Establish communication with neighbors
- Avoid unnecessary provocations
- Keep your options open

## Key Takeaways

- The first few days are crucial for setting up success
- Balance expansion with economic development
- Start with neutral territories before engaging players
- Build a balanced military force
- Begin diplomatic relations early
