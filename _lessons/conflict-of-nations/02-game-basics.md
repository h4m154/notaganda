## Understanding the Interface

Before diving into strategy, you need to understand how to navigate the game. The interface provides all the information you need to make informed decisions.

### The Map

The map is your primary view of the world. You'll see:

- **Your territories** in your nation's color
- **Enemy territories** in their respective colors
- **Neutral territories** in grey
- **Unit movements** and combat indicators

### Key Panels

- **Resource bar** - Shows your current resources and income
- **Army panel** - Lists all your military units
- **Province panel** - Details about selected provinces
- **Research panel** - Technology trees and upgrades
- **Diplomacy panel** - Relations with other nations

## Resources

Resources are the lifeblood of your nation. Understanding them is crucial.

### Primary Resources

- **Money** - Used for most purchases and maintenance
- **Supplies** - Required for unit upkeep and operations
- **Components** - Needed for advanced units and buildings

- **Rare Materials** - Used for the most advanced technologies

### Resource Generation

Each province generates resources based on:
- Province type and infrastructure

- Any active bonuses or penalties

## Provinces

Provinces are the building blocks of your empire.

### Province Types

- **Urban centers** - High population, good for money and recruitment

- **Strategic locations** - Valuable for military positioning

### Province Morale

Morale affects everything:
- Resource production
- Recruitment speed

## Time and Day Cycles

The game operates on a day cycle:

- **Day change** - Resources are calculated and distributed
- **Production completion** - Buildings and units finish at specific times
- **Event triggers** - Various game events occur at set intervals

## Key Takeaways

- Master the interface to access information quickly
- Resources determine what you can build and maintain
- Provinces vary in value and strategic importance
