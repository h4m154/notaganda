## The Economic Foundation

A strong economy wins wars. Without resources, you can't build units, maintain your military, or expand your empire.

## Understanding Resource Flow

### Income vs. Consumption

Every turn, you:
- **Gain** resources from provinces and trade
- **Lose** resources to unit upkeep and construction
- **Net change** determines your growth or decline

### The Balance Sheet

Monitor your resource balance:
- Positive balance = Growth potential
- Break-even = Stability but no expansion
- Negative balance = Crisis incoming

## Optimizing Production

### Building Placement

Place buildings strategically:

- **Arms industries** in protected provinces
- **Resource buildings** in high-output locations
- **Defensive structures** at likely attack points

### Upgrade Priorities

Focus upgrades on:

1. High-value provinces first
2. Bottleneck resources
3. Defensive infrastructure in border regions

## Managing Consumption

### Unit Upkeep

Every unit costs resources each day:

- Infantry - Low upkeep, high quantity viable
- Armor - Moderate upkeep, valuable but expensive
- Aircraft - High upkeep, powerful but resource-intensive
- Navy - Very high upkeep, use sparingly

### Reducing Waste

- Disband units you don't need
- Avoid overbuilding expensive units
- Match unit production to supply capacity
- Use efficient unit compositions

## Trade and Markets

### Trading Resources

The market allows you to:

- Sell excess resources
- Buy scarce resources
- Convert between resource types

### Market Strategy

- Buy low, sell high
- Stockpile before major operations
- Don't rely entirely on markets
- Watch for market manipulation

## Crisis Management

### When Resources Run Low

If you're running out of resources:

1. Identify the cause
2. Cut unnecessary expenses
3. Prioritize essential units
4. Seek trade deals
5. Consider strategic retreats

## Key Takeaways

- Economic strength enables military success
- Balance income and consumption carefully
- Optimize building placement and upgrades
- Manage unit upkeep efficiently
- Use markets strategically but don't depend on them
