I'm excited to announce that I'm expanding my content to a new platform! Starting next week, you'll be able to find me streaming regularly on Twitch.

## What This Means

While I'll continue to create the content you love on my existing platforms, adding Twitch to the mix will allow me to:

- **Connect with you in real-time** through live streams
- **Share my creative process** as it happens
- **Build a more interactive community** where we can engage directly

## Stream Schedule

I'll be going live according to the following schedule:

- **Tuesdays:** 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM EST
- **Saturdays:** 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM EST

## What I'll Be Streaming

My streams will focus on:

1. Live commentary on trending topics
2. Q&A sessions with viewers
3. Behind-the-scenes looks at how I create my regular content
4. Special collaborative streams with other creators

I hope you'll join me on this new adventure! You can find my Twitch channel at [twitch.tv/yourusername](https://twitch.tv/yourusername) and follow now to get notified when I go live for the first time.

Stay tuned for more updates!
